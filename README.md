Hi. I'm a starter theme called `io` and I'm about as basic as it comes. Created by Graham @ <a href="https://outrightsites.com">outrightsites.com</a> - this theme is not supported and will probably not be updated. The theme includes a menu system that drops down using CSS. The footer was also customized with Graham's info, but you can easily edit that in the "footer.php" file. 

Hope this helps someone out there.
